## Description

GrabPencil is a **tutor matching website tailored for students** at [Simon Fraser University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Fraser_University) and the [University of British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia). Students can easily create **tutor profiles** similar to LinkedIn, allowing others to view their information at a glance. The platform includes a built-in **chat system** for quick and easy communication, enabling users to freely connect with tutors that match their preferences. Additionally, GrabPencil encompasses Indeed-like **filter and search features** for enhanced user experience.

-   What was your motivation? <br/> <br/>
    My motivation stemmed from observing my peers, friends, and even my girlfriend seeking tutoring opportunities. While existing tutor matching websites were available, they were saturated with a diverse range of tutors, making it challenging for students to stand out and for users to filter through student tutors. I aimed to create a platform that simplifies this process, allowing students to showcase their tutoring capabilities more effectively and making it easier for users to connect with suitable tutors.
